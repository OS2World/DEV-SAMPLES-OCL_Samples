If your application compiles and links without problems, but it then dies
during startup (you may or may not see the frame window start to come up)
then check for the following common mistakes:
<ul>
<li>is more than one resource using the same number in your .RC or .DLG file?
<P>
<li>are you trying to allocate/create a resouce in your .CPP file -- say an
    IPushButton -- when in reality it has been defined as something else in
    your .RC or .DLG file?
<P>
<li>Bill Law (law@netscape.com) also says:  The most common occurrence is that
    your app is throwing an (uncaught) exception during construction of the
    first (frame) window.  This terminates silently, unless you take steps to
    capture the exception information.  To do that, follow the instructions
    provided in the on-line VACPP FAQ (in the section "Coding With User
    Interface Classes"->"Exceptions"->"Why Does My Program Just Exit").<br>
    <code>[Editor's note: the VACPP FAQ is D:\IBMCPP\HELP\CPPFAQ.INF]</code>
<P>
<li>did you specify the type of application when linking?  If the application
	 is compiled with the default value of <code>/pmtype:vio</code> then your
	 window will not come up.  Make certain you use <code>/pmtype:pm</code>
    from the linker, or <code>/B" /pmtype:pm"</code> when linking directly
    from the compiler.
</ul>
