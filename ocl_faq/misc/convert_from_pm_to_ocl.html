Most native PM windows have an equivalent in OCL, and an item that already
exists on a window can at any time be "converted" to OCL.  This is
advantageous for example if some of the functionality you need has already
been implemented using OCL.  For example:
<xmp>
> Can a pointer to a 'low-level' listbox be converted into a pointer to an
> Open Class listbox?
</xmp>
Dave Briccetti (daveb@davebsoft.com) says:
<xmp>
Most of the OC UI controls have a constructor that takes the HWND of an
existing control.  In this case, the constructor looks like

IListBox (const IWindowHandle &)

IWindowHandle is an "alias" for HWND.
</xmp>
Bill Law (law@netscape.com) also adds the following:
<xmp>
Perhaps you should add that if an OCL window already exists for a given HWND,
then constructing another one from its HWND will result in an exception being
thrown.  Generally, if there is a chance that an existing OCL window exists
(or you know that one does and you just want to locate it), then you can use
IWindow::fromHandle to get the existing IWindow (or derived-class) object.  If
that returns 0, then you can safely construct another IWindow
(or derived-class) object.
